# openbahn-maps

This is a small application, that was developed for a academic degree, to show the network coverage of the german mobile-provider on traintracks. The Performance lacks under the nested objects for the geocoordinates. A backend solution should help out here.

The network coverage date comes from the <a href="http://data.deutschebahn.com/index.html">Open-Data-Portal</a> of the Deutsche Bahn AG.
